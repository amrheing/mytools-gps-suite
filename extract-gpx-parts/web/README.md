## File Structure

```
web/
├── app.py                 # Flask application
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── templates/
│   ├── index.html        # Upload page
│   └── results.html      # Results page
└── static/
    ├── style.css         # Styling
    ├── script.js         # Main JavaScript
    └── results.js        # Results page JavaScript
```

## Configuration

The application can be configured by modifying these variables in `app.py`:

```python
app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 100 * 1024 * 1024  # Max file size
UPLOAD_FOLDER = Path('uploads')                        # Upload directory
PROCESSED_FOLDER = Path('processed')                   # Output directory
```

## Security Notes

- Uploaded files are kept in the archive until deleted with the delete token
- Only GPX files are accepted; XML is parsed with `defusedxml`
- File size is limited by `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH_MB` (default 100MB)
- Downloads are confined to the processed folder

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main upload page
- `POST /upload` - Handle file upload and processing
- `GET /download/<directory>/<filename>` - Download individual files
- `POST /download-selected` - Download selected files as ZIP
- `GET /download-all/<directory>` - Download all files as ZIP
- `GET /api/file-info/<directory>` - Get file information (JSON)

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- File API support required for drag & drop
- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"File too large" error**
   - Reduce file size or increase `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`

2. **"Processing failed" error**
   - Check if the file is a valid GPX format
   - Ensure the file isn't corrupted

3. **Download not working**
   - Check browser popup blocker
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled

### Development Mode

Run with debugging enabled:

```bash
FLASK_ENV=development python app.py
```

### Production Deployment

For production use, consider:
- Using a proper WSGI server (Gunicorn, uWSGI)
- Setting up reverse proxy (Nginx)
- Configuring proper file limits
- Adding authentication if needed
